# Integrated Prophetic Knowledge Structuring Architecture (IPKSA v1.2)

## Purpose
Provide a unified, verifiable system for organizing the entire hadith corpus by time, meaning, certainty, and spiritual-legal function.

## System Improvements

1. Clear separation of:
   - Historical fact
   - Scholarly consensus
   - Probabilistic inference
   - Symbolic interpretation

2. Formal epistemic layers:
   - Chronology (PCAP)
   - Semantics (HMSTS)
   - Isnād reliability
   - Inter-hadith logic
   - Spiritual pedagogy sequence

3. Machine-verifiable constraints and audit trail.

## File Roles

### 1. Era Marker CSV
Temporal coordinate system (life-tree of the Prophet ﷺ).
Defines:
- The full life-span chronology tree
- Anchor events and windows
- AH/CE alignment
- Hierarchical IDs used as temporal coordinates

### 2. PCAP.md
Rules for mapping hadith into the timeline with uncertainty control.
Governs:
- How hadith are mapped onto the tree
- How uncertainty is encoded
- How chronological consistency is preserved
- How future refinements are constrained

### 3. HMSTS.md
Rules for extracting and structuring meaning across four interpretive dimensions.
Defines:
- What “meaning” means in structured terms
- How each hadith is decomposed into parallel interpretive dimensions
- How thematic, legal, spiritual, and metaphysical content is indexed

### 4. This Document
Explains purpose, architecture, and quality-control logic.

## Processing Pipeline

1. Ingest hadith + isnād
2. Normalize text
3. Temporal anchoring via PCAP
4. Certainty scoring
5. Semantic decomposition via HMSTS
6. Cross-linking (abrogation, pedagogy, theme)
7. Consistency validation
8. Knowledge graph construction
9. Query & reasoning layer

### Design Philosophy

- Chronology as Skeleton  
- Meaning as Multi-Layer Field  
- Certainty as First-Class Data  
- Inference as Explicit, Never Hidden  
- Hierarchy Before Interpretation  
- Structure Before Insight  

## Factual Validation Framework

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Chronological contradiction | Anchor-event constraints |
| Semantic distortion | Classical commentary cross-check |
| Sectarian bias | Majority-position weighting |
| Over-inference | Probabilistic labeling |
| Concept drift | Ontology versioning |

## End State

A corpus where every hadith is:

- Time-located
- Meaning-stratified
- Certainty-graded
- Context-linked
- Hermeneutically transparent
- Computationally searchable

This enables:
- Reconstruction of Prophetic pedagogy over time
- Legal context recovery
- Spiritual progression modeling
- AI reasoning without anachronism or semantic collapse
